Persistent Pinned Tabs does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. No analytics, telemetry, or identifiers are used. No data ever leaves your device.

What the extension does locally:
- Reads minimal tab metadata (id, index, pinned, url) to determine if a tab is pinned and to open new tabs when needed
- Injects a small helper script into pages to keep single-page app navigations from replacing pinned tabs
- Listens for address-bar navigations on the active tab to preserve pinned tabs

All logic runs entirely on your machine. The extension does not send network requests beyond those your browser already makes to load the websites you visit.
